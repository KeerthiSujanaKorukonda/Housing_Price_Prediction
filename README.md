This Python code uses machine learning to predict housing prices based on features extracted from a dataset. The code first prepares the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardizing numerical features. It then splits the data into training, validation, and test sets.

The code trains three different models: linear regression, random forest regression, and a TensorFlow neural network. Each model is fitted on the training data and evaluated on the validation set using mean squared error (MSE). The model with the lowest MSE on the validation set is chosen as the "best model."

The best model is then saved and used to predict prices on the test set. The test set MSE is calculated and printed to assess the model's performance on unseen data. The code can also be used to predict prices on new data.

Overall, this code provides a general framework for housing price prediction using machine learning. Users can customize the code for different datasets, features, and models based on their specific needs.
